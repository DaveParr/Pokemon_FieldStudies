So what was Professor dsparks actually doing in the [last post]({{ site.github.url  }}//blog/2016/04/02/ridiculous)?

## 1 Reading the pokedex

Using `readLines` from `base` takes a connection to a website as one of it's arguments and returns a character vector the length of the lines read. In this case the whole webpage on [Bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_I)) for first gen pokes. From this he then extracts the table alone from all the html garbarge around it using a function from the `XML` package called `readHTMLTable`. This pulls the table which starts at line 85 called "List of Pokemon by base stats" into `theTable` list object along with some summary tables.

## 2 Data munging

The data then needs to have its headers and column types fixed, which uses `gsub` to apply some simple regex, then the `as.*` family to coerce the column types.

## 3 Scraping .pngs

### Grab URL

The urls of each of the pokemon is embedded in the `importHTML` object from earlier. To grab them Prof. dsparks wrote the [first gist: lineFinder](https://gist.github.com/dsparks/818983/)

```{r}
lineFinder <- function(string, vector){  (1:length(vector))[regexpr(string, vector) != -1]  }
```

This custom function is, like `gsub`, built on regular expressions. `lineFinder` takes the text string "http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/", and searches through the `importHTML` character list for urls that match.This also returns a fair amount of crud though. For instance:

`<td> <span class=\"plainlinks\"><a href=\"/wiki/Bulbasaur_(Pok%C3%A9mon)\" title=\"001\"><img alt=\"001\" src=\"http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/e/ec/001MS.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" /></a></span>`

### Tidy scrape

The [second gist: makeTable](https://gist.github.com/dsparks/818986) sorts all this out though.

```{r}
makeTable <- function(vector, toregex){  do.call(rbind, strsplit(vector, toregex))  }
```

When this is called with *the correct* arguments, it will split each string down to just the url. Since Prof. dsparks [originally wrote his script](https://gist.github.com/dsparks/3883468) however, it seems [Bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) have changed their default copies of the sprites from width 32 to width 40. In my reproductions I've updated the code to reflect this. This outputs a far more readable and useful url:

`"http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/e/ec/001MS.png"`

### Gotta catch 'em all!

The final step is to toss 151 master balls and pull all the .pngs down from the website.The `for` loop he uses iterates over `pokeTable`, and uses `getURLContent` from the `Rcurl` pacakage and `readPNG` from the `png` package. `getURLContent` pulls down the info for each .png, as well as the "Content-Type". Because it pulls this as well it can feed straight into readPNG, which converts this into a raster array of 4x40x40 matricies for each iteration. The loop creates a list of 151 objects. Not a coincidence!

### Viewing your Pokedex

The `iChooseYou` function is a simple wrapper to the `rasterImage` function in `base`. It takes a characcter string as an argument and finds the entry in pngList which matches it. It then takes all the data.frames at that point in the list and plots them with some preset vectors for sizing and positioning purposes.

### Like no (other pokemon) ever was!

[Principle Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) is a method of describing the relative differences of a data set over a number of different dimensions. Each pokemon (at least in Gen I) was described by 5 values: Speed, Special, HP, Attack and Defence. The resultant plots can be seen as describing on two dimensions which Pokes are most distinct from the others across each of these variables.

From this we can see a few intersting features. As we all found out very quickly 20 years ago, when MewTwo was discovered, it really stood out from the others due to the magnificent Special abilities it had (154). This is why it's so obviously in a group of it's own in the top right. 

Similarly the main Ghost and Psychic Pokemon, the  Alakazam and Geneger lines, are spread across the top. This is because of their phenomenal combination of Special and Speed (130, 154 and 120, 135 respectively.)

The Legendary Bird Trio are all clustered together, indicative of thier very similar stats. All have a Special of 125, an HP of 90, and only really vary a little across thier specialisations of Defense for Articuno, Speed for Zapdos and Attack for Moltres, hence them place closer to the lower axis. 

The middle line of the graph is almost defined as the most average. These pokemon have no obvious specialities. This is best seen in Pokemon 151. Despite how sought after it was, it is in fact the "averagest". Straight 100's across the board. Doesn't get more extremely plain than that!

The extreme edges of the bottom half of the plot all specialise in HP/Attack/Defense. Fatties like Dragonite and Snorlax, Walls such as Cloyster and Golem, and Physical Attackers such as Machamp and Kingler.

## So what so what?

This is all pretty obvious to anyone between the ages of 25 and 30, however it proves something about the metagame. That in Gen I it was common to have pokemon that had high Special and Speed, or that had high HP, Attack and Defense. It was rare to have a Poke that was a significantly powerful Special user with a lot of bulk. It was also pretty unheard of to have a fast Pokemon with high Defense. 

If an aspiring Pokemon Master had to reduce the variety of the 5 defining charateristics down to something more manageable it was easy to think of the pokemon as either Speedy and Special, or Fat and Physical. The designs display this trait as well. All the skinny alien and ghostly things up top, and the solid rocky, animal like things at the bottom.

P.S. PCA is really a fair amount more subtle than this simple description gives it credit. For a more complete explanation have a look at [setosa.io](http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/)
