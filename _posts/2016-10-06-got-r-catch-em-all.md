I travelled to the region of Budapest this summer for [SatRDays](http://budapest.satrdays.org/). It was great to see so many of my friends collecting R code, and trading experiences. I used a lightning-type talk on Pokemon at the end of the day. I've put up some neater slides on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/DaveRGP/GotRCatchEmAll), and the source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/DaveRGP/GotRCatchEmAll).

I learnt tonnes from all the speakers, but some favourites were [Arun talking about new data.table features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0gZuh5xsuo&index=7&list=PLUBl0DoLa5SDsOetNga5pt4uo6YOyKVWn)
, [Mark van der Loo's package Validate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMCc2Iu0UIQ&index=8&list=PLUBl0DoLa5SDsOetNga5pt4uo6YOyKVWn) and [Tom Levine's Music Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPz_LXbTtiI&list=PLUBl0DoLa5SDsOetNga5pt4uo6YOyKVWn&index=16). It's great to have videos of every session available ([even mine!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afVks_er01s&index=21&list=PLUBl0DoLa5SDsOetNga5pt4uo6YOyKVWn)). I've gone back to them a number of times to remind myself of key points and [some lovely moments too](https://youtu.be/MHweHr_WqqQ?t=17m16s). Thanks to [Gergely](https://about.me/daroczig) and everyone for setting it up and showing us the city. Cardiff next year?
